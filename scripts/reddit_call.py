This will likely depend on the market’s risk sentiment in the coming days, which could get a boost from Hong Kong easing travel restrictions earlier today, as well as lockdown in the tech-hub, Shenzhen, being lifted. \n\nHowever, the decision to leave the loan prime rate unchanged today seems to have disappointed traders who were hoping for further policy easing. It will also be important to watch how the situation between the US and China develops, as well as the regulatory crackdowns, both of which have the potential to drag Chinese shares lower. At the time of writing, HSI is down over 1.4% and retesting that 21,100 support level. \n\nAll trading carries risk, but it should be interesting to see if the index can avoid a close below this level and start a new leg higher, or if it's poised to attempt another downside breakout in the coming days.",

The Hang Seng has held up relatively well given the underperformance by its largest holdings over the last. If global sentiment for equities can now continue to improve, allowing markets to build on this current bounce, it could result in the Hang Seng rallying to retesting that key 25k level, and target a sustained break above. \n\nHowever, tensions in Eastern Europe are far from over, and with markets continually repricing the odds of increasingly hawkish major central banks, risk-off sentiment could quickly return amongst investors. This would likely spark another round of selling, leaving the Hang Seng exposed to another leg lower, and a continuation of its long standing downtrend. \n\nAll trading carries risk, but this definitely looks like one to keep an eye on at the moment.",

Doing so might allow the HSI to form a swing low at the current levels, and start another leg higher. \n\nWith that in mind, it should be noted that monetary policy speculation isn’t fully behind us yet, with other major central banks still scheduled to meet over the coming days.

            "text": "I reproduce  the extract of an  impartial article written by  UOB kay Hian  dated 20th January2021. I urge retail investors like us  to do your own diligence . As of now, the factors highlighted   are still applicable if  not enhanced. . Nothing had changed in the modus operandi of Oceanus. The recent sparkling result enhanced and revalidated the points highlighted.   Follow the trend, the trend is your friend.  Don’t follow the nays Sayers. \nQuote\n The recent setting up of Season Global will enable Oceanus to\nattract MNC brands and expand its China distribution business in a big way. Oceanus\ntargets to build a foodtech company and to become a regional player.\n• New CEO, stronger shareholder and joining of a reputable independent director\nListed on the SGX since 2002, Oceanus Group (Oceanus) started as an abalone\nproducer. \nIn 2014, Oceanus experienced financial difficulties due to poor management and\nindustry challenges. Current CEO Peter Koh was a shareholder before he joined Oceanus\nat end-14. Peter has driven a strong turnaround as promised by growing revenue\nsignificantly, and he now aims to take Oceanus to a higher level with his wide business\nconnection and management track record. The key initiatives undertaken by Peter include:\na) cost cutting in Dec 14; b) clean-up operations in 2016; and c) strengthen the balance\nsheet in 2017 after reducing its debt to zero. Alacrity Investment Group (Alacrity) became\nOceanus’ largest shareholder in mid-20 after taking over the stake from a creditor group.\nAlacrity is an investment arm of an Indonesia conglomerate that has interest in the retail\nand logistics sector. It has long-term plans to help Oceanus expand its presence in the\naquaculture chain. In late-20, former minister Yaacob Ibrahim joined Oceanus as an\nindependent director, and this could strengthen corporate governance and show better\nconfidence in the company.\n• Season Global will penetrate China and deliver exponential growth. Oceanus’s 3Q20\nrevenue of Rmb135m has grown more than sixfold yoy, thanks to its strategy in building\nthe distribution business via the setting up of Season Global since Jan 20. The JV partner\nis a China FMCG conglomerate which has around 40 years of track record, more than\n1,000 stock keep units from foodstuffs to alcohol and generates around S$200m revenue.\nOceanus and the JV partner have invested S$20m, and significant growth is expected with\nthe opening up of markets and set-up of the e-commerce trading platform.\n• Targets to expand high-tech farming with regional presence. Oceanus envisions the\n2021-23 period to be its tech-up phase. COVID-19 has accelerated the demand for many\nmajor cities to build their own food supplies as a contingency plan. This has opened up\nmany JV opportunities in the ASEAN, China and the Middle East regions. To achieve its\ngoal of building a foodtech company with regional presence, Oceanus aims to establish\nintellectual properties, build a network of key partners and embark on a global deployment\nof Oceanus foodtech hubs. In Sep 20, Oceanus invested an undisclosed amount in\nUniversal Aquaculture, which has developed a novel shrimp farming facility in Singapore.\nThis could help develop in-house technology with a low capex business model. In Nov 20,\nOceanus signed an agreement with Hainan Raffles Group to set up the world’s first\nOceanus foodtech Hub in Hainan, China, a key aquaculture centre for shrimp and fish\nfarming in the region.\n\nNear-term key catalysts include:\n• Exiting from the SGX watch-list. Based on the profitability of Rmb6.1m achieved in\n9M20, Oceanus is on track to fulfil the condition to exit from the SGX watch-list. In Jan 21,\nOceanus announced that it is no longer in the SGX list that requires mandatory quarterly\nfinancial reporting. This is an upgrade of confidence from SGX as it is loosening its\nreporting requirement for Oceanus.\n• Exponential revenue and earnings growth from Season Global. Since establishing\nSeason Global JV in Jan 20, the revenue and net profit of Oceanus has grown\nsignificantly. In 3Q20, Oceanus’ revenue grew by 626% yoy (+276% qoq) and net profit\nmade a turnaround to Rmb2.5m from a loss of Rmb1.4m earlier. Oceanus expects this\ndistribution division to drive significant growth with the opening up of more markets,\nespecially in China.\n• Further expansion of aquaculture businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has\naccelerated the demand for many major cities to build their own food supplies. This could\nopen up more opportunities for Oceanus to deploy its foodtech hubs which utilise high-tech\nand vertical farming in key cities across China, ASEAN and the Middle East.\n\nkey catalysts for price up trend \n• Exiting from the SGX watch-list.  Ticked YES \n• Exponential revenue and earnings growth from Season Global Ticked yes \n• Further expansion of aquaculture businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has\naccelerated the demand for many major cities to build their own food supplies.

Ticked yes \n\nThere were comments about Fed taperwing QE resulting interest rate spikes. Let me assure you it will affect drastically  the high valued stocks with high dividend yields.  Why because of the big capital outlay . You can put in the bank to earn higher interest.\nIt will affect less Penny stocks like Oceanus  why. As long as Oceanus is fundamentally viable, It will enhance investing in Oceanus because of low capital outlay and the returns from your investment will outweigh you putting the meagre amount in the bank. There will be shift of focus to penny stock with good potential and fundamental.",

With Joey Choy's reputation as Singapore's renowned mentor and as one of the Top Tier Remisiers and Trader, he might have some influence through his analyst.\n\nLink: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6EOxCASIQ&t=647s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6EOxCASIQ&t=647s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Terenece Cao Partnering**\n\nTerence's home-based F&B business sets up Mee Siam delivery and partners with nine Singaporean farms to sell their produce on its site. The first of these being Oceanus Group's abalone.\n\nLink: [https://www.8days.sg/eatanddrink/newsandopening/terence-cao-sets-up-mee-siam-delivery-biz-gets-700-enquiries-on-14225762](https://www.8days.sg/eatanddrink/newsandopening/terence-cao-sets-up-mee-siam-delivery-biz-gets-700-enquiries-on-14225762)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Since 2018, Oceanus Group has constantly generated increasing profits year after year. The amazing growth of **200% - 300%**  per year due to their **strategize 4 pillars of growth**. **Gaining revenue from 4 different sectors, Aquaculture, Distribution, Services, and Innovation**. Their latest revenue between 2019 to Q1-Q3 2020, shows an increase of 305%. ( Exponential revenue and earnings growth )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. As CEO Peter Koh joins Oceanus Group in 2014, he **managed to turn the company around** from being heavily in debt to absolutely **no debt** by 2017. This allows Oceanus Group to achieve their first 'Clean' audit opinion in Nine Years. This could only be done after successfully resolving all legacy issues that have caused disclaimer of opinions from its auditors between FY2011 to FY2017.\n\nLink: [https://oceanus.com.sg/oceanus-achieves-first-clean-audit-opinion-in-nine-years/](https://oceanus.com.sg/oceanus-achieves-first-clean-audit-opinion-in-nine-years/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Seeing Oceanus Group's growth potential, **former Minister Yaccob Ibrahim joins Oceanus Group as an independent director** and invested in the company in 2020. With former Minister Yaccob Ibrahim involvement in the company, Oceanus Group will indefinitely move faster and stronger forward with his skills and knowledge in his sector.\n\nLink: [https://oceanus.com.sg/former-minister-yaacob-ibrahim-joins-oceanus-as-independent-director/](https://oceanus.com.sg/former-minister-yaacob-ibrahim-joins-oceanus-as-independent-director/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Oceanus Group has plans to apply out of SGX watchlist in April 2021 after auditing their FY2020 results. The result on whether they have successfully exited out of SGX watchlist will be announced in Q3/4 2021. Looking at how Oceanus Group has progressed over the years and their confidence in applying out of SGX watchlist, I feel there will be positive news in Q3/4 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pumr6ppqpli61.jpg?width=1701&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1bfc37b207f25badd265b1b7aa1b10812293d24\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51ske6lrpli61.jpg?width=1701&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89cf6e593c4ed2cac530c6bc0ff8ff67b50b4bd7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1skhl2dspli61.jpg?width=1701&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddd570a358dcb1716b7d7bf36d6ce7946f360355\n\nLink: [https://www.facebook.com/OceanusGroupLimited/posts/877066023043380](https://www.facebook.com/OceanusGroupLimited/posts/877066023043380)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Because of the pandemic crisis in 2020, it was a nudge for many companies. Oceanus Group realizes that they will need to evolve from past practices to survive the pandemic and so they did. They have been constantly innovating since 2015. This allowed Oceanus Group to continue to grow revenue and profit even in 2020. The journey has only just begun, especially as they kickstart their 3-year plan of Tech-Up phase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gy8692hupli61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=593526b587e122199bcef971633c3aafce19dc2e\n\nAn exciting project that Oceanus has was their Aquapolis City project with 2 other companies, Shaw Investment Holdings, and China Construction Seventh Engineering Division. The project was created to tackle food security concerns from governments around the world. It is a sea-based hi-tech aquaponics farm that aims to be the solution to food security and safety in Singapore and beyond. Although Oceanus Group has not released any updates or progress of the Aquapolis project, I hope to hear more about it in their 3-year tech-up phase.\n\nLink: [https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/oceanus-partners-shaw-investment-holdings-chinese-construction-firm-to-enhance](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/oceanus-partners-shaw-investment-holdings-chinese-construction-firm-to-enhance)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Oceanus Group is set to release its Q4 2020 earnings report in February. I am confident that their earnings report will be good as having a good consistent financial profit year over year is one of the criteria to be able to apply out of SGX watchlist.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujomp0nwpli61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e315f9db12280b62f585ac7a26db151f7579999\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. I came upon Oceanus Market Depth data while researching and noticed something interesting. The amount of shares at the sell queue is decreasing over time compared to when it was priced at $0.03. When the share price was at $0.03, the selling volume was at close to 40-50 million shares, and as of 19/02/2020, the share price at $0.076 was around 20-30 million shares. I am not sure about you, but this tells me that many Oceanus Group supporters are holding on to their shares because they believe in the company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqfk9fozpli61.jpg?width=631&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47e04879afc239e623285461ec6a47b5dd4b6e90\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Investment***\n\nOceanus Group in 2020 has been making strategic investments towards the food-tech space. Investment such as:  \n\n\n1. Investment in Universal Aquaculture for Deep Tech Indoor Prawn breeding.\n\nLink: [https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/oceanus-invests-in-deep-tech-firm-to-breed-prawns](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/oceanus-invests-in-deep-tech-firm-to-breed-prawns)\n\n2. Signed an agreement with Hainan Raffles Group, to set up the world's first Oceanus FoodTech Hub in Hainan. A key aquaculture center for shrimp and fish farming in the region.\n\nLink: [https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/Q98FNYLCZ2E1YRFB/669685e053e41e000255387677e65a2f6919e620ef5c6b240ce4eb1a489ba10d?fbclid=IwAR38wSvIJMLFq\\_KUBYI0nmhTuNodYfg22ztw-z58JpcVCDyLA6ibWb-OYGM](https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/Q98FNYLCZ2E1YRFB/669685e053e41e000255387677e65a2f6919e620ef5c6b240ce4eb1a489ba10d?fbclid=IwAR38wSvIJMLFq_KUBYI0nmhTuNodYfg22ztw-z58JpcVCDyLA6ibWb-OYGM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Upcoming Near-term key Catalyst***  \n\n\n1. **Q4 2020 Results**. The Q4 2020 results will be released this coming February and in my opinion, it will no doubt be great as compared to the previous quarter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **Exiting from SGX watch-list**. Based on the profitability achieved in Q1-Q3 2020, Oceanus is on track to fulfill the condition to exit from SGX watch-list. This is an upgrade of confidence from SGX as it is loosening its reporting requirement for Oceanus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Exponential revenue and earnings growth from Season Global**. Since establishing Season Global JV in Jan 2020, the revenue of Oceanus Group has grown significantly. In Q1-Q3 2020, Oceanus Group's revenue grew by 626% year over year ( +276% quarter over quarter ) and made a turnaround from a loss to profit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. **Further expansion of aquaculture businesses**. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the demand for many major cities to build their own food supplies. The could open up more opportunities for Oceanus to deploy its food tech hubs in key cities across China, ASEAN, and the Middle East.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Bearish Opinion***\n\nOf course, there will definitely be some bearish opinions as there is bullish.  \n\n\n1. Oceanus Group's valuation is a whopping $1.822 billion as of this writing. Its share price is at $0.075 on 19/02/2020 closing.   \n\n\n2. Oceanus Group's P/B ratio is at 76.27x as compared to its fair value and price relative to the market.\n\nLink: [https://www.theedgesingapore.com/capital/right-timing/caution-warranted-penny-stocks-overbought-highs-sti-slumps](https://www.theedgesingapore.com/capital/right-timing/caution-warranted-penny-stocks-overbought-highs-sti-slumps)  \n\n\nBased on the above numbers, Oceanus Group is overvalued as compared to other counters such as First Resources Ltd, Bumitama Agri Ltd, and Indofood Agri Resources Ltd to name a few. However, I would not use these numbers to value Oceanus Group as it is a growth company. We invest based on how we see the company's future, and from how I see it, Oceanus Group is en route to greater growth and earnings with strong fundamentals that are built since 2014.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Other Links***  \n\n\nTo those who would love to know more about Oceanus Group or where I get my research from, below are a few links provided for your convenience.  \n\n\n**UOB KayHian Analyst Report on Oceanus Group**\n\nLink: [https://research.sginvestors.io/2021/01/oceanus-group-uob-kay-hian-research-2021-01-20.html](https://research.sginvestors.io/2021/01/oceanus-group-uob-kay-hian-research-2021-01-20.html)  \n\n\n**89.3 Money FM interview on Oceanus Group CEO Peter Koh**\n\nLink: [https://omny.fm/shows/money-fm-893/driving-a-resilient-aquaculture-business-amid-covi?fbclid=IwAR2YoxNBFyWbjDwkaVmAeCBDYYLvRP40hC5KttwRnBWPhgJd5IMSrSxYvQA#description](https://omny.fm/shows/money-fm-893/driving-a-resilient-aquaculture-business-amid-covi?fbclid=IwAR2YoxNBFyWbjDwkaVmAeCBDYYLvRP40hC5KttwRnBWPhgJd5IMSrSxYvQA#description)  \n\n\n**Oceanus Facebook (Oceanus post updates on their progress)**\n\nLink: [https://www.facebook.com/OceanusGroupLimited](https://www.facebook.com/OceanusGroupLimited)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer**: All content on this post is for informational & educational purposes only, and shouldn't be taken as personalized financial advice.

FINAL DUE D by greg\\_dfvalue!  \n\n\n>I think people will eat more abalone in the future.\n\nYONG HUI: Is abalone consumption growing?\n\n  \nPETER: Yes, I think people will eat more abalone in the future. A lot of restaurants and weddings are now shying away from shark's fins due to environmental reasons. This helps increase the demand for abalone.\\xa0Recently, many are also using abalone in yusheng instead of raw fish. Petrol kiosks also ran out of abalone during the Chinese New Year period.\n\n  \nYONG HUI: What is your retail strategy? Are you competing on price?\n\n  \nPETER: I don’t want to fight on price, because if we fight a price war, the company will not survive. We will price it in a way which is value for money, with the focus on quality, rather than being cheap or expensive. Generally, abalone isn’t cheap as people know. Anyone who buys abalone does not mind paying a few more dollars. They go for the quality and taste. We also want our abalones\\xa0to be\\xa0halal-certified.\n\n  \nYONG HUI: Are non-Chinese eating abalone?\n\n  \nPETER: It is still a small number now, but it will grow with education. Some try out\\xa0of curiosity. Why do the Chinese like it so much? It is slowly opening up, and this will give us a larger market.\n\n  \nYONG HUI: Is Indonesia one of the markets you want to educate?\n\n  \nPETER: We are looking to enter the whole of Asia-Pacific.\n\n  \nYONG HUI: Where can people expect to find your abalone?  \nPETER: We will start with e-commerce because we are not large-scale enough for the traditional channels—neither do we have the retail operations or the SKUs for that, so we will tie up with ecommerce partners, as well as through our own ecommerce channel.\n\n  \nMORALITY ETHICS CHECK\n\n  \nYONG HUI: How do you ensure the quality of your abalone?  \nPETER: For example, even though we have to pay two or three times more to ship our abalones to Australia to process it there, we do it. We have been approached by very questionable vendors in China who promised us many things. They say they can “value-add” at no extra cost, to make the abalones look bigger and whiter. The only condition is not to\\xa0ask how they do it! We are not comfortable with such things.\n\n  \nPOWER INDON BIZ  \nYONG HUI: Will your canned abalones be branded Oceanus?  \nPETER: Yes, and that explains why we are so careful about this, because we are literally\\xa0putting the company's name on the product.  \nYONG HUI: What has been the response so far?  \nPETER: There was this Indonesia couple whom I know through a friend—they wanted to throw a feast and wanted to buy some abalone, so we sent them a few cans. They got back, with an order for ten cartons. We are not the cheapest, but yet they chose our abalones. She brought me into their kitchen and showed me a whole row of other brands they had tried. She asked why our abalones aren’t bigger. . . so I explained to her.\n\n  \nHOW NOT TO INVEST IN OCEANUS AND THIS MAN \\[Read on\\]\n\n  \nPETER: What shareholders should do is believe in themselves. After seeing what we as a company is doing to change, they have to decide. In the past, there was a lot of talk,\\xa0but nothing happened. Right now, they have to see for themselves whether we have changed, and did we see things through and deliver our plans.\\xa0During our last AGM, there were a lot of questions from disgruntled shareholders, but\\xa0what started off as\\xa0a rowdy crowd, at\\xa0the end, they understood better\\xa0where\\xa0Oceanus is heading. What took me by surprise was this middle-aged lady who shouted: Mister CEO, now that you have said all these, should I buy more shares? \\[*laughs*\\] That was\\xa0a very difficult question. Look, I cannot control the market. I can tell you what the direction of the company is, but I cannot tell you how to invest your money.\\xa0Interestingly enough,\\xa0this other gentleman who was quite vocal shouted back—what are you waiting for? Go and buy!\n\n  \nYONG HUI: Will you consider taking the company private?\n\n  \nPETER: We don't have that in mind.\n\n  \nYONG HUI: Might that be beneficial for the company?\n\n  \nPETER: It won’t be beneficial to the shareholders. When you do that, it is over for the shareholders who bought earlier. It isn’t doing them a service.\\xa0My moral obligation is to do well for our shareholders and employees. I have to be accountable to shareholders.\n\n  \nhttps://www.hnworth.com/article/become/high-profiles/peter-koh-ceo-oceanus-group-limited/",

Valid Concern, though read below. \n\n2. More Naysayers + Shortists which also means more Contra Buyers (i.e Speculation + Smart Alecs)\n\n70 Million Shorts YTD + More At Forum shouting down: The issue is we are NOT sure if Oceanus BB want to support, Long Retails have Limited Funds.

If possible Try 4.38PM and each buy up as much as u can. then leave half to park at the price you buy. Say we manage to buy up 6.3. Then Block 6.3, force the shorts to cover 6.4 and beyond. If ONE day we strong enough, we play better block 6.3 and queue 6.5, make the shorts lose 2 pips. LAGI best is alot of Shorts queue say 6.6.
